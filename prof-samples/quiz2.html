<h2>Super Banger project idea:</h2>
<p>Scraping the data from either the textbook, slides, or the HTML on the previous pages, get chatGPT to generate multiple choice questions assigned with sections / readings. If you create 100 questions, roughly equally distributed for each week/section, you could write some javascript to test the user. Then, after the user takes the test, they could be pointed in the correct direction for further reading. Feel free to hmu if you want to work on this!</p>
