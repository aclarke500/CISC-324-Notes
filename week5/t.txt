So here we have some processes all in their critical section. Meaning, they are likely writing to memory and cannot be prempted. There exists some resource R, such that for all R, it is being occupied by a processes in its critical section. This process,is holding one resource and waiting for another as it needs both. Hence it won't release it until it gets the other resource. However, some other process is holding onto THAT resource, until it gets the other resource. If there is a set of threads where they are all waiting on some resource held by another thread in that set, they are said to be deadlocked.
