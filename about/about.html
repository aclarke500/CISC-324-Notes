  <p>This is an application to make studying for the 324 quizzes easier. I am of the opinion that the class is made more difficult/boring than it needs to be, so I've developed this website to help students study. The site goes through the assigned readings, and summarizes the notes swiftly. It also links to a pdf copy found online, so students can do additional readings if they feel the provided summaries are not enough. This is also an open source application, and users are encouraged to make modifications to 1) make the site more usable, and up to date for later student cohorts 2) so they can fork this project and list themselves as open source contributors.</p>
  <p>This is an open source project by students for students.
    Feel free to make suggestions, edit the wording, styling (please) and I will update the site accordingly.
