<h3>9.1.1 Basic Hardware</h3>
<h3>Basic Hardware</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Main memory and CPU core registers are directly accessible by the CPU.</li>
  <li>Machine instructions can reference memory addresses, not disk addresses.</li>
  <li>Instructions and data must be in direct-access storage devices for CPU execution.</li>
  <li>Data not in memory must be moved there for CPU operations.</li>
  <li>CPU core registers are accessible within one CPU clock cycle.</li>
  <li>Memory access is slower, requiring a transaction on the memory bus, taking multiple CPU cycles.</li>
  <li>Processors may stall if data needed for instructions is not immediately available.</li>
  <li>To mitigate memory access delays, fast memory caches are added between the CPU and main memory.</li>
  <li>Cache management is automatic and hardware-implemented, without operating system control.</li>
  <li>Physical memory access speed and correct operation are critical for system functionality.</li>
  <li>Hardware must protect the operating system and user processes from unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Protection is provided by hardware using base and limit registers to define accessible memory ranges.</li>
  <li>Base register holds the smallest legal physical memory address; limit register specifies the range size.</li>
  <li>CPU hardware compares every user-mode generated address with these registers to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Base and limit registers are loaded only by the operating system using privileged instructions.</li>
  <li>Operating system has unrestricted access to its own and users' memory for management and service provision.</li>

<h3>9.1.2 Address Binding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programs reside on disk as binary executable files and must be loaded into memory to run.</li>
  <li>They are placed within a process context, becoming eligible for CPU execution.</li>
  <li>During execution, the process accesses its instructions and data from memory.</li>
  <li>Upon termination, the process's memory is freed for other processes.</li>
  <li>User processes can occupy any part of physical memory, not necessarily starting at address 00000.</li>
  <li>The operating system manages the placement of processes in physical memory.</li>
  <li>User programs undergo several steps before execution, with addresses represented differently at each step:</li>
  <li>Symbols in source code are bound to relocatable addresses by a compiler.</li>
  <li>Relocatable addresses are then bound to absolute addresses by a linker or loader.</li>
  <li>Binding of instructions and data to memory addresses can occur at different times:</li>
  <li>Compile time: If the memory location is known, absolute code is generated.</li>
  <li>If the location changes later, the code must be recompiled.</li>
  <li>Load time: If the memory location is not known at compile time, relocatable code is generated.</li>
  <li>Final binding is delayed until the code is loaded into memory.</li>
  <li>Execution time: If the process can move during execution, binding is delayed until runtime.</li>
  <li>Special hardware is required for runtime binding.</li>
  <li>Most operating systems bind addresses at execution time.</li>
  <li>The chapter discusses various binding implementations.</li>

<h3>9.1.3 Logical Versus Physical Address Space</h3>
<h4>Logical Adresses</h4>
<ul>
  <li>These are what the CPU "sees".</li>
  <li>Sometimes called virtual address.</li>
  <li>Set of all logical/virtual address is called logical address space.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Physical Adresses</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This is what the memory management unit sees.</li>
  <li>Set of all physical addresses is called physical address space.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MMU</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Memory-management unit (MMU) is a hardware device  handles runtime mapping from virtual to physical addresses. (Figure)</li>
  <li>Essentially acts as pointer between CPU and real memory.</li>
  <li>Multiple different implemetations are possible. </li>
  <li>For instance, a relocation register in MMU adds its value to each user-generated address for memory access.</li>
  <li>So logical addresses would behave between 0-n, whereas MMU would map to physical adresses of k-k+n</li>

</ul>
<h4>Comparison</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Compile or load time binding results in identical logical and physical addresses.</li>
  <li>Execution-time binding leads to different logical (virtual) and physical addresses.</li>
  <li>Memory-management unit (MMU) is a hardware device  handles runtime mapping from virtual to physical addresses. (Figure)Â£</li>
  
  <li>User programs deal with logical addresses; hardware converts these to physical addresses.</li>
  <li>Logical addresses are mapped to physical addresses before use.</li>
  <li>Logical address space is separate from physical address space, crucial for memory management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.1.4 Dynamic Loading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Previously, entire programs and data had to be in memory for execution, limiting process size to physical memory capacity.</li>
  <li>Dynamic loading overcomes this by loading routines on demand, rather than at process start.</li>
  <li>Main program is loaded into memory, while other routines remain on disk in a relocatable format.</li>
  <li>When a routine calls another, it checks if the latter is loaded; if not, a relocatable linking loader loads it and updates address tables.</li>
  <li>This selective loading is beneficial for handling large code segments needed only occasionally, like error routines.</li>
  <li>User responsibility is to design programs for dynamic loading, with the operating system potentially providing supportive libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.1.5 Dynamic Linking and Shared Libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) are linked at runtime, contrasting with static linking where system libraries are pre-bound at compile time.</li>
  <li>Dynamic linking defers the linking of libraries to execution time, saving memory by sharing libraries like the C standard library across programs.</li>
  <li>When a program uses a DLL routine, the loader locates and, if necessary, loads the DLL into memory, adjusting program references accordingly.</li>
  <li>Updates to DLLs, such as bug fixes, automatically propagate to all programs using the DLL without the need for recompilation.</li>
  <li>Version information in DLLs ensures compatibility, allowing multiple versions to coexist and be used according to program compilation specifics.</li>
  <li>Dynamic linking and shared libraries typically require operating system mechanisms for checking routines in memory spaces and managing shared access.</li>
</ul>
