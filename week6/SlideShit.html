<h2>Other types of addresses</h2>
<p>This is to complement Logical and Physical addresses, which can be seen at <a href="./chapter9.html">week 6 chapter 9</a> .</p>

<h3>Symbolic Addresses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Variables declared by the dev</li>
  <li><code>int x;</code> Here, <code>x</code> is symbolic as it has no specific memory location yet.</li>
  <li>They are used to represent memory locations of variables or functions that don't have hard values yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relocatable Adresses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not tied to a specific location, rather can be "relocated" during runtime or during the loading process.</li>
<li>For instance, if we have <code>function add(num1, num2)</code> for our code snippet, these would be relocatable as their location would get specified at runtime (I think).</li>
</ul>
